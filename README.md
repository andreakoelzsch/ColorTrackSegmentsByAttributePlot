## Documentation
This App is embedded in an shiny UI, enabling the user to interactively select the attribute by which the segments of the track should be colored, the individuals to be display, the color gradient and if the tracks should be displayed all in one panel, or in multiple panels (one per individual). The created plot can than be saved via the `Save plot` button.
